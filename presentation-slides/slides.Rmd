# The Task

"Objective of this submission study is to evaluate whether the concentration of biomarker ‘AB’ above a cutoff of 50ng/mL, measured at the 20th gestational week, could predict a preterm delivery for pregnant women. A known confounding factor is age.
Please prepare an analysis plan of approx. 10 presentation slides, covering at least the following aspects:

* study objective
* sample size
* primary analysis

and present it within 20 min to the audience. You may decide about further assumptions, e.g. about effect size of the biomarker or age. Important is that your analysis plan is coherent."

### Background: Preterm Delivery (PD) [1]

* 1 in 10 babies born before week 37 (in the US)
* **PD: established risk factor** for multitude of child morbidities

### Study Objective

* *"Objective of this submission study is to evaluate whether the concentration of biomarker 'AB' above a cutoff of 50ng/mL, measured at the 20th gestational week, could predict a preterm delivery for pregnant women."*

### Rationale for Study

* Identified early: **preventative care** for PD possible
* **Assumption:** AB measurable with ignorable risk to mother and child </br>
(e.g. maternal blood sample, vaginal secretion swab) $\leadsto$ positive risk-benefit

# Statistical Model

* Binary biomarker, cutoff already fixed: $\operatorname{AB}_{0/1} := \operatorname{AB}(20) \geq 50\operatorname{ng/mL}$

* **Assumption:** measurement modalities of $\operatorname{AB}(20)$ sufficiently well defined

* Maternal age is **confounder** $\leadsto$ affects both risk of $\operatorname{PD}$ and level of $\operatorname{AB}_{0/1}$

```

* Logistic regression model: $\operatorname{PD} \sim \operatorname{Age} + \operatorname{AB}_{0/1}$, adjust for confounder

* **Assumption:** no relevant interaction effect between $\operatorname{Age}$ and $\operatorname{AB}_{0/1}$

* Let $\beta_{\operatorname{AB}}$ be regression coefficient of $\operatorname{AB}_{0/1}$ (adjusted log OR)

* $\mathcal{H}_0: \beta_{\operatorname{AB}} = 0$, test via asymptotic, model-based t-test

# Non-Linear Age Effect

.pull-left[

* $\operatorname{PD} \sim \operatorname{Age} + \operatorname{AB}_{0/1}$ implies linear effect on log OR of age

* Implausible [3] $\leadsto$ biased $\widehat{\beta_{\operatorname{AB}}}$

* Solution: binned age groups

* Define **discrete** $\operatorname{Age}_{dscr}$ using categories from [3] (starting at 18 years)

# Study Design

* Endpoint properties:
	1. Delayed response (0 to 17 weeks)
	2. Common indication / broad target population
	3. **Assumption:** measuring "AB" is cheap (**low marginal cost** of inclusion)
	
* $\leadsto$ group-sequential design unlikely to be beneficial </br> (long delay after recruitment stop)

* Better: recruit ASAP, single-stage, multi-centric 

* Adjust for center variation via random effect (save degrees of freedom)

* Staff/participants **blinded** to biomarker result </br>
(Discussion: unethical if strong prior evidence of biomarker performance!)

# Sample Size - Determinants
	
Sample size for logistic regression with binary predictor [4]

1. Overall event rate: $\operatorname{Pr}[\operatorname{PD}=1] = 1/10$, known from  [1]

2. Prevalence of biomarker: $\operatorname{Pr}[\operatorname{AB}_{0/1} = 1]$ 

3. Effect size risk difference:
$$\operatorname{Pr}[\operatorname{PD} = 1|\operatorname{AB}_{0/1} = 1, \operatorname{Age}] - \operatorname{Pr}[\operatorname{PD} = 1|\operatorname{AB}_{0/1} = 0, \operatorname{Age}]$$

4. $\rho:=\operatorname{cor}[\operatorname{AB}_{0/1},\operatorname{Age}]$ (for variance inflation factor)

5. Conditional error rates </br>
	$\alpha=0.05$ (two-sided) </br>
	$\beta=0.10$ (some flexibility here $\leadsto$ utility maximization?)

6. Dropout rate: (iatrogenic) abort, withdrawal of consent, loss-to-follow-up, ...

# Sample Size - Assumptions

Biomarker prevalence $\operatorname{Pr}[\operatorname{AB}_{0/1}=1]$

* Should be known before submission study
* Unlikely to be frequent: Highly prevalent biomarker cannot lead to big risk difference (not specific)
* **Assumption:** $\operatorname{Pr}[\operatorname{AB}_{0/1}=1] = 1/10$

Correlation coefficient $\rho$ of age and biomarker
* Age is confounder $\leadsto$ must be positive
* Not too big, otherwise age proxy for biomarker $\leadsto$ useless
* **Assumption:** $\rho=0.2$

Dropout rate
* late (post 20 weeks) aborts very rare
* withdrawal of consent + loss-to-follow-up could be an issue since long follow-up and low-stakes towards the end
* **Assumption:** dropout rate of $5\%$

# Effect Size


```{r pd-risk, echo=FALSE, out.height="300px", out.width="450px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pd-risk.png")
```

* Maximal age effect is about $2\%$ [3]

* **Assumption:** Good biomarker: three times the effect of age </br>
	$\leadsto$ population average risk difference of $6\%$

* Minimum of $100$ per center to avoid centers without PD (random effect unstable!)

* With 20 centers: $180$ per center, i.e. $\approx 18$ PD cases per center

# Trial Duration

* **Assumption:** average birth clinic $\approx 1500$ births per year [5]
	
* **Assumption:** negligible risk from measuring "AB", 10% recruitment potential </br> 
	$\leadsto 150/\operatorname{center}/\operatorname{year}$

* Delayed response of (mostly) 17 weeks $\approx 4$ months for normal pregnancy

* $\leadsto$ Overall duration from recruitment start: about 1.5 to 2 years

# Missing Values

* Missing covariates: MCAR plausible

* Low rate of dropout expected ( $\approx 5\%$ ) $\leadsto$ power not an issue, bias?

* Endpoint MCAR debatable:
	* Dropout could $\nearrow$ over time as consequences of PD $\searrow$
	* If subhazard of PD not constant, $\leadsto$ dropout and PD not independent

* Regression: CCA unbiased if dropout $\perp \!\!\! \perp$ of outcome given predictors [6]

* If "AB" is prognostic of birth date: dropout approx. $\perp \!\!\! \perp$ given "AB" </br>
	$\leadsto$ under alternative: CCA ok

* Problem: CCA potentially not valid under $\mathcal{H}_0$

* Solution: add more predictors (e.g. "smoking") to regression model </br>
	$\leadsto$ MAR of endpoint more plausible

# Primary Analysis

* CCA of all participants who did not withdraw consent

* t-test for non-null fixed effect of $\operatorname{Age}_{dscr}$ in mixed-effects logistic regression 
$$\operatorname{PD} \sim \operatorname{Age}_{dscr} + \operatorname{AB}_{0/1} + \operatorname{smoking} + (1 | \operatorname{center})$$

* Mixed effects degrees of freedom for t-statistic: Satterthwaite method [7]

* Using R (4.0.5) + lmer (1.1-26) + lmertest (3.1-3)

* Report aOR + 95% CI as effect measure and compare with aOR of age groups

* Report sensitivity / specificity with 95% CI (Clopper-Pearson)

# Further Points

* Study design:
	* Blinding of staff/participants to results - ethical?
	* **Preventive therapy**: might delay but not prevent PD? What if it does?

* Sensitivity/secondary analyses:
	* Missing values worst/best case
	* **Per-protocol** analysis (exclude "AB" measurement outside of week 20)
	* **ROC analysis** of continuous "AB" - cut-off right?
	* Parametric **survival analysis** (log-normal model) of
	$$\operatorname{time-to-birth} \sim \operatorname{Age}_{dscr} + \operatorname{AB}(20) + (1 | \operatorname{center})$$
	How does "AB" influence 'birth hazard' between week 20 and 37?

* Sample Size:
	* Explore sample size / power **interactively**: https://bit.ly/3xIS4sf
	* **Bayesian sample size**: prior on effect and nuisance parameters </br>
	$\leadsto$ minimize expected sample size or **maximize expected utility**

```

* Successful treatment would negate prognostic value (negative mediation)

* Estimand: prognostic effect under no treatment, under treatment as usual, under treatment conditional on biomarker?

* Treatment might need to be randomized conditional on biomarker to make effect identifiable
